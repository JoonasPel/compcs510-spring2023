1. cmd to folder node-docker-demo
2. type "docker compose up --build"
3. wait
4. when you see the message: "!!!!!!! I AM SERVER B WAITING FOR MESSAGES !!!!!!!!!!!"
everything is running and ready.
5. in your own browser go to "localhost:3000/something" (literally "something")
6. Server A receives this request (it exposes port 3000 to outside of container) and
then it sends a message through rabbit to server B. In cmd you can see:
"Received message in server B:  Hello from Server A"
