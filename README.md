This project is an application made with Docker, where the user is offered the possibility to order sandwiches through a React frontend, track the progress of orders, and create a user account. In addition to this, the admin user can create/delete sandwich options. The backend contains Docker containers, of which the first is Server A, that handles requests coming from the frontend, saving information to a PostgreSQL database and sending new bread orders to a RabbitMQ queue. Server B acts as the consumer, simply taking orders from the queue, "preparing" them for a while, and returning them to another queue where the finished orders go. The application also includes an adminer container, which allows for convenient handling of the PostgreSQL database. The co-operation between frontend and backend was successful using the Swagger API.
